abstract = {Spectral library searching is a popular approach for MS/MS-based peptide identification. Because the size of spectral libraries continues to grow, the performance of searching algorithms is an important issue. This technical note introduces a strategy based on a minimum shared peak count between two spectra to reduce the set of admissible candidate spectra when issuing a query. A theoretical validation through time complexity analysis and an experimental validation based on an implementation of the candidate reduction strategy show that the approach can achieve a reduction of the set of candidate spectra by (at least) an order of magnitude, resulting in a significant improvement in the speed of the search. Meanwhile, more than 99{\%} of the positive search results is retained. This efficient strategy to drastically improve the speed of spectral library searching with a negligible loss of sensitivity can be applied to any current spectral library search tool, irrespective of the employed similarity metric.},
