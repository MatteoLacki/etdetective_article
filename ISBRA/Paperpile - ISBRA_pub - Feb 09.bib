                 some of its newer applications including characterization of
                 PTMs, non-tryptic peptides and intact proteins. We will also
                 discuss some of the unique features of ETD such as its
                 complementarity with CID and the use of alternating CID/ETD
                 along with issues pertaining to analysis of ETD data. The

  author   = "Chen, Jun and Li, Hongzhe",
  abstract = "With the development of next generation sequencing technology,
              researchers have now been able to study the microbiome
              composition using direct sequencing, whose output are bacterial
              taxa counts for each microbiome sample. One goal of microbiome
              study is to associate the microbiome composition with
              environmental covariates. We propose to model the taxa counts
              using a Dirichlet-multinomial (DM) regression model in order to
              account for overdispersion of observed counts. The DM regression
              model can be used for testing the association between taxa
              composition and covariates using the likelihood ratio test.
              However, when the number of the covariates is large, multiple
              testing can lead to loss of power. To deal with the high
              dimensionality of the problem, we develop a penalized likelihood
              approach to estimate the regression parameters and to select the
              variables by imposing a sparse group [Formula: see text] penalty
              to encourage both group-level and within-group sparsity. Such a
              variable selection procedure can lead to selection of the
              relevant covariates and their associated bacterial taxa. An
              efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to
              solve the optimization problem. We present extensive simulations
              to demonstrate that the sparse DM regression can result in better
              identification of the microbiome-associated covariates than
              models that ignore overdispersion or only consider the
              proportions. We demonstrate the power of our method in an
              analysis of a data set evaluating the effects of nutrient intake
              on human gut microbiome composition. Our results have clearly
              shown that the nutrient intake is strongly associated with the

              techniques in both native and non-native top-down mass
              spectrometry. However, several competing reactions---primarily
              different forms of charge reduction---occur under ETD
              condi-tions, as evidenced by the distorted isotope patterns
              usually observed. In this work, we analyze these isotope patterns
              to compare the stability of nondissociative electron transfer
              (ETnoD) products, specifically noncovalent c/z fragment
              complexes, across a range of ubiquitin conformational states.
              Using ion mobility, we find that more extended states are more
              prone to fragment release. We obtain evidence that for a given
              charge state, populations of ubiquitin ions formed either
              directly by electrospray ionization or through collapse of more
              extended states upon charge reduction, span a similar range of

              however, less stabilized towards unfolding than the native

              previous conformational states. Furthermore, this collapse of
              charge-reduced ions is promoted if the ions are 'preheated' using
              collisional activation, with possible implications for the
              kinetics of gas-phase compaction.",

              intensity patterns present in mass spectra. Here, we demonstrate
              that intensity pattern modeling improves peptide and protein
              identification from MS/MS spectra. We modeled fragment ion
              intensities using a machine-learning approach that estimates the
              likelihood of observed intensities given peptide and fragment
              attributes. From 1,000,000 spectra, we chose 27,000 with
              high-quality, nonredundant matches as training data. Using the
              same 27,000 spectra, intensity was similarly modeled with
              mismatched peptides. We used these two probabilistic models to
              compute the relative likelihood of an observed spectrum given
              that a candidate peptide is matched or mismatched. We used a
              'decoy' proteome approach to estimate incorrect match
              frequency(7), and demonstrated that an intensity-based method
              reduces peptide identification error by 50-96\% without any loss

              tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking
              program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and
              systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing
              Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of
              the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based
              implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among
              the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD
              $\leq$ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from
              21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced
              peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to
              the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the
              recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for
              these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster.
              Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an
              unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\%
              of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and

  title    = "Ion/ion chemistry of high-mass multiply charged ions",
  author   = "McLuckey, S a and Stephenson, J L",
  abstract = "Electrospray ionization has enabled the establishment of a new
              area of ion chemistry research based on the study of the
              reactions of high-mass multiply charged ions with ions of
              opposite polarity. The multiple-charging phenomenon associated
              with electrospray makes possible the generation of multiply
              charged reactant ions that yield charged products as a result of
              partial neutralization due to ion/ion chemistry. The charged
              products can be readily studied with mass spectrometric methods,
              providing useful insights into reaction mechanisms. This review
              presents the research done in this area, all of which has been
              performed within the past decade. Ion/ion chemistry has been
              studied at near-atmospheric pressure in a reaction region that
              leads to the atmospheric/vacuum interface of a mass spectrometer,
              and within a quadrupole ion trap operated with a bath gas at a
              pressure of 1 mtorr. Proton transfer has been the most common
              reaction type for high-mass ions, but other forms of ``charge
              transfer,'' such as electron transfer and fluoride transfer, have
              also been observed. For some ion/ion reactions, attachment of the
              two reactants has been observed. Multiply charged ion/ion
              reactions are fast, due to the long-range Coulombic attraction,
              and they are universal in that any pair of oppositely charged
              ions is expected to react due to the high exothermicity
              associated with mutual neutralization. The kinetics of reaction
              for multiply charged ions, derived from the same molecule with a
              given singly charged reactant ion, follow a charge-squared
              dependence, at least under normal quadrupole ion trap conditions.
              This dependence suggests that reaction rates are determined by
              the long-range Coulomb attraction, and that the ions react with
              constant efficiency as a function of charge state. In the case of
              proton transfer reactions from polypeptides to even-electron
              perfluorocarbon anions, no fragmentation of the polypeptide
              product ions has, as yet, been observed. Electron transfer from
              small oligonucleotide anions to rare gas cations, on the other
              hand, results in extensive fragmentation of the nucleic acid
              product ions. The extent of fragmentation decreases as the size
              of the oligonucleotide anions increases, reflecting a decrease in
              fragmentation rates associated with an increase in the number of
              internal degrees of freedom of the oligonucleotide. When
              ion-cooling rates become competitive with dissociation rates, the
              initially formed product ions are stabilized and fragmentation is
              avoided. Collisional cooling, therefore, likely plays an
              important role in the relative lack of dissociation observed thus
              far as a result of ion/ion reactions for most high-mass ions. The
              observed dependence of ion/ion reaction rates on the square of
              the ion charge, the universal nature of mutual neutralization,
              and the relative lack of fragmentation that arises from ion/ion
              reactions, makes ion/ion chemistry a particularly useful means
              for manipulating charge states. This review emphasizes
              applications that take advantage of the unique characteristics of
              ion/ion proton transfer chemistry for manipulating charge states.
              These applications include mixture analysis by electrospray,
              precursor ion charge state manipulation for tandem mass
              spectrometry studies, and simplified interpretation of product
