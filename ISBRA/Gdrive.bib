  abstract = "Characterization of all gas-phase charge sites of natively
              sprayed proteins and peptides is demonstrated using 193 nm UVPD.
              The high sequence coverage offered by UVPD is exploited for the
              accurate determination of charge sites in protein systems up to
              18 kDa, allowing charge site to be studied as a function of
              protein conformation and the presence of disulfide bonds.
              Charging protons are found on both basic sidechains and on the
              amide backbone of less basic amino acids such as serine,
              glutamine, and proline. UVPD analysis was performed on the 3+
              charge state of melittin, the 5+ to 8+ charge states of
              ubiquitin, and the 8+ charge state of reduced and oxidized
              $\beta$-lactoglobulin. The location of charges in gas-phase
              proteins is known to impact structure; molecular modeling of
              different charge site motifs of 3+ melittin demonstrates how
              placement of protons in simulations can dramatically impact the
              predicted structure of the molecule. The location of positive
              charge sites in ubiquitin and $\beta$-lactoglobulin are
              additionally found to depend on the presence or absence of
              salt-bridges, columbic repulsion across the length of the
              peptide, and protein conformation. Charge site isomers are
              demonstrated for ubiquitin and $\beta$-lactoglobulin but found to
              be much less numerous than previously predicted.",

  abstract = "Protein identification and peptide sequencing by tandem mass
              spectrometry requires knowledge of how peptides fragment in the
              gas phase, specifically which bonds are broken and where the
              charge(s) resides in the products. For many peptides, cleavage at
              the amide bonds dominate, producing a series of ions that are
              designated b and y. For other peptides, enhanced cleavage occurs
              at just one or two amino acid residues. Surface-induced
              dissociation, along with gas-phase collision-induced dissociation
              performed under a variety of conditions, has been used to refine
              the general 'mobile proton' model and to determine how and why
              enhanced cleavages occur at aspartic acid residues and protonated
              histidine residues. Enhanced cleavage at acidic residues occurs
              when the charge is unavailable to the peptide backbone or the
              acidic side-chain. The acidic H of the side-chain then serves to
              initiate cleavage at the amide bond immediately C-terminal to Asp
              (or Glu), producing an anhydride. In contrast, enhanced cleavage
              occurs at His when the His side-chain is protonated, turning His
              into a weak acid that can initiate backbone cleavage by
              transferring a proton to the backbone. This allows the
              nucleophilic nitrogen of the His side-chain to attack and form a
              cyclic structure that is different from the 'typical' backbone
              cleavage structures.",

              peptides dissociated in a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer.
              The model includes most fragmentation pathways described in the
              literature, plus some additional pathways based on the author's
              observations. The model was trained by optimizing parameters
              within the model for predictions of CID spectra of known
              peptides. A best set of parameters was optimized to obtain best
              match between the simulated spectra and the experimental spectra
              in a training data set. The performance of the mathematical model
              and the associated optimized parameter set used in the CID

  abstract = "Owing to its versatility, electron transfer dissociation (ETD)
              has become one of the most commonly utilized fragmentation
              techniques in both native and non-native top-down mass
              spectrometry. However, several competing reactions-primarily
              different forms of charge reduction-occur under ETD conditions,
              as evidenced by the distorted isotope patterns usually observed.
              In this work, we analyze these isotope patterns to compare the
              stability of nondissociative electron transfer (ETnoD) products,
              specifically noncovalent c/z fragment complexes, across a range
              of ubiquitin conformational states. Using ion mobility, we find
              that more extended states are more prone to fragment release. We
              obtain evidence that for a given charge state, populations of
              ubiquitin ions formed either directly by electrospray ionization
              or through collapse of more extended states upon charge
              reduction, span a similar range of collision cross-sections.
              Products of gas-phase collapse are, however, less stabilized
              towards unfolding than the native conformation, indicating that
              the ions retain a memory of previous conformational states.
              Furthermore, this collapse of charge-reduced ions is promoted if
              the ions are 'preheated' using collisional activation, with
              possible implications for the kinetics of gas-phase compaction.
