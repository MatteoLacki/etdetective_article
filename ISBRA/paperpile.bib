  abstract = "Owing to its versatility, electron transfer dissociation (ETD)
              has become one of the most commonly utilized fragmentation
              techniques in both native and non-native top-down mass
              spectrometry. However, several competing reactions-primarily
              different forms of charge reduction-occur under ETD conditions,
              as evidenced by the distorted isotope patterns usually observed.
              In this work, we analyze these isotope patterns to compare the
              stability of nondissociative electron transfer (ETnoD) products,
              specifically noncovalent c/z fragment complexes, across a range
              of ubiquitin conformational states. Using ion mobility, we find
              that more extended states are more prone to fragment release. We
              obtain evidence that for a given charge state, populations of
              ubiquitin ions formed either directly by electrospray ionization
              or through collapse of more extended states upon charge
              reduction, span a similar range of collision cross-sections.
              Products of gas-phase collapse are, however, less stabilized
              towards unfolding than the native conformation, indicating that
              the ions retain a memory of previous conformational states.
              Furthermore, this collapse of charge-reduced ions is promoted if
              the ions are 'preheated' using collisional activation, with
              possible implications for the kinetics of gas-phase compaction.

              spectrometry requires knowledge of how peptides fragment in the
              gas phase, specifically which bonds are broken and where the
              charge(s) resides in the products. For many peptides, cleavage at
              the amide bonds dominate, producing a series of ions that are
              designated b and y. For other peptides, enhanced cleavage occurs
              at just one or two amino acid residues. Surface-induced
              dissociation, along with gas-phase collision-induced dissociation
              performed under a variety of conditions, has been used to refine
              the general 'mobile proton' model and to determine how and why
              enhanced cleavages occur at aspartic acid residues and protonated
              histidine residues. Enhanced cleavage at acidic residues occurs
              when the charge is unavailable to the peptide backbone or the
              acidic side-chain. The acidic H of the side-chain then serves to
              initiate cleavage at the amide bond immediately C-terminal to Asp
              (or Glu), producing an anhydride. In contrast, enhanced cleavage
              occurs at His when the His side-chain is protonated, turning His
              into a weak acid that can initiate backbone cleavage by
              transferring a proton to the backbone. This allows the
              nucleophilic nitrogen of the His side-chain to attack and form a

  abstract = "Electrospray ionization has enabled the establishment of a new
              area of ion chemistry research based on the study of the
              reactions of high-mass multiply charged ions with ions of
              opposite polarity. The multiple-charging phenomenon associated
              with electrospray makes possible the generation of multiply
              charged reactant ions that yield charged products as a result of
              partial neutralization due to ion/ion chemistry. The charged
              products can be readily studied with mass spectrometric methods,
              providing useful insights into reaction mechanisms. This review
              presents the research done in this area, all of which has been
              performed within the past decade. Ion/ion chemistry has been
              studied at near-atmospheric pressure in a reaction region that
              leads to the atmospheric/vacuum interface of a mass spectrometer,
              and within a quadrupole ion trap operated with a bath gas at a
              pressure of 1 mtorr. Proton transfer has been the most common
              reaction type for high-mass ions, but other forms of ``charge
              transfer,'' such as electron transfer and fluoride transfer, have
              also been observed. For some ion/ion reactions, attachment of the
              two reactants has been observed. Multiply charged ion/ion
              reactions are fast, due to the long-range Coulombic attraction,
              and they are universal in that any pair of oppositely charged
              ions is expected to react due to the high exothermicity
              associated with mutual neutralization. The kinetics of reaction
              for multiply charged ions, derived from the same molecule with a
              given singly charged reactant ion, follow a charge-squared
              dependence, at least under normal quadrupole ion trap conditions.
              This dependence suggests that reaction rates are determined by
              the long-range Coulomb attraction, and that the ions react with
              constant efficiency as a function of charge state. In the case of
              proton transfer reactions from polypeptides to even-electron
              perfluorocarbon anions, no fragmentation of the polypeptide
              product ions has, as yet, been observed. Electron transfer from
              small oligonucleotide anions to rare gas cations, on the other
              hand, results in extensive fragmentation of the nucleic acid
              product ions. The extent of fragmentation decreases as the size
              of the oligonucleotide anions increases, reflecting a decrease in
              fragmentation rates associated with an increase in the number of
              internal degrees of freedom of the oligonucleotide. When
              ion-cooling rates become competitive with dissociation rates, the
              initially formed product ions are stabilized and fragmentation is
              avoided. Collisional cooling, therefore, likely plays an
              important role in the relative lack of dissociation observed thus
              far as a result of ion/ion reactions for most high-mass ions. The
              observed dependence of ion/ion reaction rates on the square of
              the ion charge, the universal nature of mutual neutralization,
              and the relative lack of fragmentation that arises from ion/ion
              reactions, makes ion/ion chemistry a particularly useful means
              for manipulating charge states. This review emphasizes
              applications that take advantage of the unique characteristics of
              ion/ion proton transfer chemistry for manipulating charge states.
              These applications include mixture analysis by electrospray,
              precursor ion charge state manipulation for tandem mass
              spectrometry studies, and simplified interpretation of product

              techniques in both native and non-native top-down mass

              different forms of charge reduction---occur under ETD
              condi-tions, as evidenced by the distorted isotope patterns
              usually observed. In this work, we analyze these isotope patterns
              to compare the stability of nondissociative electron transfer
              (ETnoD) products, specifically noncovalent c/z fragment
              complexes, across a range of ubiquitin conformational states.
              Using ion mobility, we find that more extended states are more
              prone to fragment release. We obtain evidence that for a given
              charge state, populations of ubiquitin ions formed either
              directly by electrospray ionization or through collapse of more
              extended states upon charge reduction, span a similar range of
              collision cross-sections. Products of gas-phase collapse are,
              however, less stabilized towards unfolding than the native
              conformation, indicating that the ions retain a memory of

              with an application to microbiome data analysis",
  author   = "Chen, Jun and Li, Hongzhe",
  abstract = "With the development of next generation sequencing technology,
              researchers have now been able to study the microbiome
              composition using direct sequencing, whose output are bacterial
              taxa counts for each microbiome sample. One goal of microbiome
              study is to associate the microbiome composition with
              environmental covariates. We propose to model the taxa counts
              using a Dirichlet-multinomial (DM) regression model in order to
              account for overdispersion of observed counts. The DM regression
              model can be used for testing the association between taxa
              composition and covariates using the likelihood ratio test.
              However, when the number of the covariates is large, multiple
              testing can lead to loss of power. To deal with the high
              dimensionality of the problem, we develop a penalized likelihood
              approach to estimate the regression parameters and to select the
              variables by imposing a sparse group [Formula: see text] penalty
              to encourage both group-level and within-group sparsity. Such a
              variable selection procedure can lead to selection of the
              relevant covariates and their associated bacterial taxa. An
              efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to
              solve the optimization problem. We present extensive simulations
              to demonstrate that the sparse DM regression can result in better
              identification of the microbiome-associated covariates than
              models that ignore overdispersion or only consider the
              proportions. We demonstrate the power of our method in an
              analysis of a data set evaluating the effects of nutrient intake
              on human gut microbiome composition. Our results have clearly
              shown that the nutrient intake is strongly associated with the

                 dissociation (ECD and ETD) are investigated by covalently
                 attaching a free-radical hydrogen atom scavenger to a peptide.
                 The 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-l-oxyl (TEMPO) radical was
                 chosen as the scavenger due to its high hydrogen atom affinity
                 (ca. 280 kJ/mol) and low electron affinity (ca. 0.45 ev), and
                 was derivatized to the model peptide, FQX(TEMPO)EEQQQTEDELQDK.
                 The X(TEMPO) residue represents a cysteinyl residue
                 derivatized with an acetamido-TEMPO group. The acetamide group
                 without TEMPO was also examined as a control. The gas phase
                 proton affinity (882 kJ/mol) of TEMPO is similar to backbone
                 amide carbonyls (889 kJ/mol), minimizing perturbation to
                 internal solvation and sites of protonation of the derivatized
                 peptides. Collision induced dissociation (CID) of the TEMPO
                 tagged peptide dication generated stable odd-electron b and y
                 type ions without indication of any TEMPO radical induced
                 fragmentation initiated by hydrogen abstraction. The type and
                 abundance of fragment ions observed in the CID spectra of the
                 TEMPO and acetamide tagged peptides are very similar. However,
                 ECD of the TEMPO labeled peptide dication yielded no backbone
                 cleavage. We propose that a labile hydrogen atom in the charge
                 reduced radical ions is scavenged by the TEMPO radical moiety,
                 resulting in inhibition of N-C$\alpha$ backbone cleavage
                 processes. Supplemental activation after electron attachment
                 (ETcaD) and CID of the charge-reduced precursor ion generated
                 by electron transfer of the TEMPO tagged peptide dication
                 produced a series of b + H (b(H)) and y + H (y(H)) ions along
                 with some c ions having suppressed intensities, consistent
                 with stable O-H bond formation at the TEMPO group. In summary,
                 the results indicate that ECD and ETD backbone cleavage
                 processes are inhibited by scavenging of a labile hydrogen
                 atom by the localized TEMPO radical moiety. This observation
                 supports the conjecture that ECD and ETD processes involve
                 long-lived intermediates formed by electron capture/transfer
                 in which a labile hydrogen atom is present and plays a key
                 role with low energy processes leading to c and z ion
                 formation. Ab initio and density functional calculations are
                 performed to support our conclusion, which depends most
                 importantly on the proton affinity, electron affinity and
                 hydrogen atom affinity of the TEMPO moiety.",

                 mechanism of these processes. The model peptide
                 FQpSEEQQQTEDELQDK, containing a phosphoserine residue, was
                 converted to EA-tuned peptides via beta-elimination and
                 Michael addition of various thiol compounds. These include
                 propanyl, benzyl, 4-cyanobenzyl, perfluorobenzyl,
                 3,5-dicyanobenzyl, 3-nitrobenzyl, and 3,5-dinitrobenzyl
                 structural moieties, having a range of EA from -1.15 to +1.65
                 eV, excluding the propanyl group. Typical ECD or ETD backbone
                 fragmentations are completely inhibited in peptides with
                 substituent tags having EA over 1.00 eV, which are referred to
                 as electron predators in this work. Nearly identical rates of
                 electron capture by the dications substituted by the benzyl
                 (EA = -1.15 eV) and 3-nitrobenzyl (EA = 1.00 eV) moieties are
                 observed, which indicates the similarity of electron capture
                 cross sections for the two derivatized peptides. This
                 observation leads to the inference that electron capture
                 kinetics are governed by the long-range electron-dication
                 interaction and are not affected by side chain derivatives
                 with positive EA. Once an electron is captured to high-n
                 Rydberg states, however, through-space or through-bond
                 electron transfer to the EA-tuning tags or low-n Rydberg
                 states via potential curve crossing occurs in competition with
                 transfer to the amide pi* orbital. The energetics of these
                 processes are evaluated using time-dependent density
                 functional theory with a series of reduced model systems. The
                 intramolecular electron transfer process is modulated by
                 structure-dependent hydrogen bonds and is heavily affected by
                 the presence and type of electron-withdrawing groups in the
                 EA-tuning tag. The anion radicals formed by electron predators
                 have high proton affinities (approximately 1400 kJ/mol for the
                 3-nitrobenzyl anion radical) in comparison to other basic
                 sites in the model peptide dication, facilitating exothermic
                 proton transfer from one of the two sites of protonation. This
                 interrupts the normal sequence of events in ECD or ETD,
                 leading to backbone fragmentation by forming a stable radical
                 intermediate. The implications which these results have for

              composition using direct sequencing, whose output are bacterial
              taxa counts for each microbiome sample. One goal of microbiome
              study is to associate the microbiome composition with
              environmental covariates. We propose to model the taxa counts
              using a Dirichlet-multinomial (DM) regression model in order to
              account for overdispersion of observed counts. The DM regression
              model can be used for testing the association between taxa
              composition and covariates using the likelihood ratio test.
              However, when the number of the covariates is large, multiple
              testing can lead to loss of power. To deal with the high
              dimensionality of the problem, we develop a penalized likelihood
              approach to estimate the regression parameters and to select the
              variables by imposing a sparse group [Formula: see text] penalty
              to encourage both group-level and within-group sparsity. Such a
              variable selection procedure can lead to selection of the
              relevant covariates and their associated bacterial taxa. An
              efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to
              solve the optimization problem. We present extensive simulations
              to demonstrate that the sparse DM regression can result in better
              identification of the microbiome-associated covariates than
              models that ignore overdispersion or only consider the

              the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD
              $\leq$ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from
              21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced
              peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to
              the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the
              recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for
              these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster.
              Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an
              unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\%
              of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and
              find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for
              extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges,
              defining a domain of applicability for this approach.",

              traditional collision induced dissociation (CID) b and y ion
              formation, ETD generates c and z ions and the backbone cleavage
              is believed to be less selective. We have reported previously the
              application of a statistical data mining strategy, K-means
              clustering, to discover fragmentation patterns for CID, and here
              we report application of this approach to ETD spectra. We use ETD
              data sets from digestions with three different proteases. Data
              analysis shows that selective cleavages do exist for ETD, with
              the fragmentation patterns affected by protease, charge states,
              and amino acid residue compositions. It is also noticed that the
              c(n-1) ion, corresponding to loss of the C-terminal amino acid
              residue, is statistically strong regardless of the residue at the
              C-terminus of the peptide, which suggests that the peptide gas

                 unusually valuable for ``top down'' protein sequencing and
                 identification/localization of posttranslational
                 modifications, because the ECD product ions can represent
                 cleavages between most of a protein's amino acids. As
                 proposed, this unusual reactivity results from immediate local
                 utilization, before randomization, of much of the relatively
                 large ( approximately 6 eV) energy from the electron reaction
                 with the multiply charged protein ion, minimizing the effect
                 of differences in the backbone bond dissociation energies.
                 However, others conclude that e(-) capture produces a labile
                 free radical species for which backbone cleavage is the lowest
                 energy reaction. Supporting the nonergodic mechanism, ECD of
                 ubiquitin (M + 12H)(12+) ions also yields thermalized radical
                 (M + 12H)(11+.) ions that instead lose H. when activated.
                 Also, the ECD spectrum of ubiquitin (M + 13H)(13+) ions is
                 nearly unchanged by heating from 25 degrees C to 125 degrees
                 C, demonstrating that this increase in thermal energy is small
                 compared to the energy driving the reaction. These results
                 support initial capture of the electron in a long-lived high-n
                 Rydberg state, followed by internal conversion to the product
                 valence state at an energy well above the dissociation
                 barriers. The instantaneous conformation of the valence state
                 is critical, with the observed products supporting an
                 alpha-helical structure in which the protonated side chain of
                 each basic residue is intercalated to hydrogen-bond to as many
                 as three amide carbonyls. Activation (e.g., heat, collisions,
                 lowered charge) can disrupt this conformation to allow
                 additional H(+)-side-chain interactions and provide more

  title    = "Ion/ion chemistry of high-mass multiply charged ions",
  author   = "McLuckey, S a and Stephenson, J L",
  abstract = "Electrospray ionization has enabled the establishment of a new
              area of ion chemistry research based on the study of the
              reactions of high-mass multiply charged ions with ions of
              opposite polarity. The multiple-charging phenomenon associated
              with electrospray makes possible the generation of multiply
              charged reactant ions that yield charged products as a result of
              partial neutralization due to ion/ion chemistry. The charged
              products can be readily studied with mass spectrometric methods,
              providing useful insights into reaction mechanisms. This review
              presents the research done in this area, all of which has been
              performed within the past decade. Ion/ion chemistry has been
              studied at near-atmospheric pressure in a reaction region that
              leads to the atmospheric/vacuum interface of a mass spectrometer,
              and within a quadrupole ion trap operated with a bath gas at a
              pressure of 1 mtorr. Proton transfer has been the most common
              reaction type for high-mass ions, but other forms of ``charge
              transfer,'' such as electron transfer and fluoride transfer, have
              also been observed. For some ion/ion reactions, attachment of the
              two reactants has been observed. Multiply charged ion/ion
              reactions are fast, due to the long-range Coulombic attraction,
              and they are universal in that any pair of oppositely charged
              ions is expected to react due to the high exothermicity
              associated with mutual neutralization. The kinetics of reaction
              for multiply charged ions, derived from the same molecule with a
              given singly charged reactant ion, follow a charge-squared
              dependence, at least under normal quadrupole ion trap conditions.
              This dependence suggests that reaction rates are determined by
              the long-range Coulomb attraction, and that the ions react with
              constant efficiency as a function of charge state. In the case of
              proton transfer reactions from polypeptides to even-electron
              perfluorocarbon anions, no fragmentation of the polypeptide
              product ions has, as yet, been observed. Electron transfer from
              small oligonucleotide anions to rare gas cations, on the other
              hand, results in extensive fragmentation of the nucleic acid
              product ions. The extent of fragmentation decreases as the size
              of the oligonucleotide anions increases, reflecting a decrease in
              fragmentation rates associated with an increase in the number of
              internal degrees of freedom of the oligonucleotide. When
              ion-cooling rates become competitive with dissociation rates, the
              initially formed product ions are stabilized and fragmentation is
              avoided. Collisional cooling, therefore, likely plays an
              important role in the relative lack of dissociation observed thus
              far as a result of ion/ion reactions for most high-mass ions. The
              observed dependence of ion/ion reaction rates on the square of
              the ion charge, the universal nature of mutual neutralization,
              and the relative lack of fragmentation that arises from ion/ion
              reactions, makes ion/ion chemistry a particularly useful means
              for manipulating charge states. This review emphasizes
              applications that take advantage of the unique characteristics of
              ion/ion proton transfer chemistry for manipulating charge states.
              These applications include mixture analysis by electrospray,
              precursor ion charge state manipulation for tandem mass
              spectrometry studies, and simplified interpretation of product
